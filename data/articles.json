Investors decide to buy or sell based on the company’s performance, economic conditions, the current price of the shares, and other factors. Not every investor makes decisions based on the same criteria, and what might not seem rational to one investor, will seem perfectly acceptable to another. This dynamic keeps shares trading hands and makes future prices difficult to predict. People purchase stocks for a lot of reasons. Some hold onto shares, looking for income from dividends. Others might think a stock will rise, so they snap it up, trying to buy low and sell high. Still, others might be interested in having a say in how particular companies are run. That’s because you can vote at shareholder meetings based on the number of shares you own. Both “stock market” and “stock exchange” are often used interchangeably, but they’re not the same. Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares on one or more stock exchanges, which are only part of the overall stock market. The major U.S. stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. How Does the Stock Market Work? The Stock Market Defined The stock market is a vast, complex network of trading activities where shares of companies are bought and sold, protected by laws against fraud and other unfair trading practices. It plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling money to move between investors and companies. Sometimes the best way to see how something works is to look at its parts. In that light, let's review the major elements of the stock market, from the companies selling shares to stocks to exchanges to the indexes that give us a snapshot of the stock market's health: What Are Public Companies? Not all companies can offer stock to the public. Only public companies that have offered their shares for the first time in an initial public offering (IPO) can have their stock bought and sold on exchanges like the NYSE or Nasdaq. From the time a company starts planning its IPO through all the time its shares are sold to the public, it must meet stringent regulations and financial disclosure laws. The primary market could involve raising money and giving parts of a business to friends, family, and others in direct trades, making it the oldest way of dividing shares in a company. Since the primary market is where a company sells its securities directly, today it includes IPOs, follow-on public offerings, private placements, debt offerings, and other times when a company sells part of itself to raise funds. From then on, stocks are traded in the secondary market on exchanges or over the counter. More than 58,000 companies worldwide are publicly traded today. What Are Stocks: Buying and Selling Shares When you buy a stock or a share, you're getting a piece of that company. How much of the company you own depends on the number of shares the company has issued and the number of shares you own. If it's a small, private company, a single share could represent a large part of the company. Major public companies often have millions, even billions, of shares. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) has billions of shares in circulation, so a single share is just a tiny fraction of the company. Owning shares gives you the right to part of the company's profits, often paid as dividends, and sometimes the right to vote on company matters. What Is a Stock Exchange? Once a company goes public, its stocks can be traded freely on the stock market. This means that investors can buy and sell shares among themselves. This is the secondary market for stocks, and most trading is done through stock exchanges. This part of the larger stock market dates to at least 1602 in Amsterdam, evolving since into some of the world's most complex institutions. Stock exchanges are organized and regulated places (much trading today is virtual) where stocks and other types of securities are bought and sold. They play a crucial role in the financial system by providing a platform for companies to raise money by selling their stocks and bonds to the public. The NYSE and Nasdaq are prime examples, serving as central locations for the buying and selling of stocks. There are major exchanges worldwide, such as the London Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Each has its own internal rules, and investors follow different national and local laws. These are meant to ensure fair trading practices and to keep investors confident in dealing there. They also provide transparency in the trading process, giving real-time information on securities prices, which is why it's so easy to find up-to-date stock prices on just about any financial news site. Stock exchanges wouldn't live up to their name, though, if they didn't offer liquidity, the ability to buy or sell stocks relatively easily. This means that during trading hours, you can buy a stock quickly or just as rapidly sell it to raise cash. Many stock exchanges also cross-list company shares, offering securities primarily listed on other exchanges. This way, companies can reach more investors when raising capital, and those trading with certain exchanges have far more options. and The price of a stock changes based on the demand for shares from new investors who want to buy, or the supply of shares from existing investors who want to sell.
